Old text sentiment analysis techniques often neglect the context when it is used in the expression of features. In this research, we have implemented a scalable and robust CNN (Convolutional neural network) to address the issue of text-based film review sentiment analysis. The proposed method classifies the sentiment of sentences in the Rotten Tomatoes data set. Basically, it is a multi-class classification, which means that the data set have more than 2 classes for classifying the movies. Finally, we are evaluating the model on testing dataset to check how it performs by calculating Accuracy, Recall, Precision and figure of merit measures. It gives accuracy of 87% when adam is used and 37% when sgd optimizer is used. Moreover, this paper also discuss about the previously implemented research work on sentiment analysis which uses different methods on various dataset.
